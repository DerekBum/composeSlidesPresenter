## Slides presenter plugin
This is a plugin to show slides and code examples directly from IntelliJ IDEs.

## Why?
It can be useful if large part of your presentation is based on code examples, so instead of copy-pasting code into Keynote or PowerPoint slides you can show both slides and code in IDE. 
 
 - Code examples stay up-to-date. 
 - You can run and modify code examples live to show how they work.
 - Smooth transition between slides and code examples.
